The Contoso University sample web app ([tutorial here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio)) demonstrates how to create an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app using Entity Framework (EF) Core.

The sample app is a web site for a fictional Contoso University. It includes functionality such as student admission, course creation, and instructor assignments.
